# How should you create your own data file?

## The sequence
The first thing you must do is follow the rules of consistency.
* Report`s title
* Your variant 
* Your name
* Your exercises
  * Exercise`s question
  * Input data
  * Output data
  * Mathematical model
  * Picture`s path
  * Count of tests
  * Tests
  * Program`s code

You can find file example in my repository - data.txt

## Punctuation rules
It is my first program, so it has some strict punctuation rules.

1. If your data occupies more than one line you should enter
"+" sign __BEFORE__ line and __AFTER__. Example:
<img src="file:///C:\Users\vanil\Desktop\1.jpg">

2. You should enter "+" sign **BEFORE AND AFTER EACH** test.
Don`t forget enter count of tests. Program will not understand
how many tests should be in your task. Example:
<img src="file:///C:\Users\vanil\Desktop\2.jpg">

3. You should enter FULL path to your picture if it is not in 
a same folder with your file. 
    * When it is not in a same folder.
      * C:\Users\vanil\Desktop\data.txt
      
    * When it is in a same folder:
        * data.txt
        
In the end, I want to add that all these rules are important.
Therefore you should follow all of them!
